### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Run

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/truongcongthanh2000/crypto-trading-news
cd crypto-trading-news

# Create config
cp config/config_remote.yaml.cfg config/config_remote.yaml

# Run
python3 -m crypto_trading_news
```

## Deployment
### Cloud platform
In this project, I use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as cloud platform for deployment. Here is the config 
- [Buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
    - heroku/python
    - https://github.com/playwright-community/heroku-playwright-buildpack.git
- Region: **Europe** (**Note: Avoid choose USA because lack of support API from binance.us**)
- Stack: **heroku-22** (**Note: Do not use latest version heroku-24 because of incompatible with playwright**)
- Add-ons: **[Fixie](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/fixie)** for forward-proxy to binance APIs.

**Notes**: To scrape [Threads](https://www.threads.com), you need proxies to avoid rate limits. If you already have a rotating proxy service, set the environment variable ```TOR_PROXY_URL``` with its address. If not, note that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is not suitable for this project because it cannot run Tor or custom proxy services. In that case, it‚Äôs recommended to deploy on a VPS, where you have full control over networking and proxy configuration.
### VPS
If you prefer to run this project on your own server instead of a PaaS like Heroku, you can deploy to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) such as **AWS EC2**, **DigitalOcean Droplet**, or **Vultr Instance**.

#### Provision a VPS
   - Choose a Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended) with default version Python 3.10.
   - Minimum resources: **2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM** for smooth operation with Playwright.
#### Install & Run
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/truongcongthanh2000/crypto-trading-news
cd crypto-trading-news

# Create config
cp config/config_remote.yaml.cfg config/config_remote.yaml
# Fill required fields in config_remote.yaml

# Install system dependencies
bash install.sh

# Run without tor proxy
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m crypto_trading_news

# Run with tor proxy, fill field tor_proxy and num_ports in config_remote.yaml, ex: "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050", 4
NUM_PORTS=<number_of_ports> MAX_CIRCUIT=<seconds> pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
# Example: NUM_PORTS=5 MAX_CIRCUIT=300 pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -> opens 9050..9054, circuit rotates every 300s
# Example: NUM_PORTS=5 pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -> opens 9050..9052, circuit rotates every 600s
# Example: pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -> opens only 9050, circuit rotates every 600s
```
