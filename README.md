## Deployment
### Cloud platform
In this project, I use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as cloud platform for deployment. Here is the config 
- [Buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
    - heroku/python
    - https://github.com/playwright-community/heroku-playwright-buildpack.git
- Region: **Europe** (**Note: Avoid choose USA because lack of support API from binance.us**)
- Stack: **heroku-22** (**Note: Do not use latest version heroku-24 because of incompatible with playwright**)
- Add-ons: **[Fixie](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/fixie)** for forward-proxy to binance APIs.
### VPS
If you prefer to run this project on your own server instead of a PaaS like Heroku, you can deploy to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) such as **AWS EC2**, **DigitalOcean Droplet**, or **Vultr Instance**.

#### Provision a VPS
   - Choose a Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended) with default version Python 3.10.
   - Minimum resources: **2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM** for smooth operation with Playwright.
#### Install & Run
```bash
# Clone repository

# Fill required fields in config_remote.yaml

# Install system dependencies

# If you use tor proxy, you should start service tor before running
